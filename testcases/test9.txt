There’s been a really bad accident on Highway 12 near exit 45. I was driving behind, and it looks like one of the drivers is seriously injured. There are two cars involved, and I’d say at least three people. One of the drivers is out of their car and seems okay, but the other is not moving, and their car is completely wrecked. We need an ambulance and police here right away.
