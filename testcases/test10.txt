Hello, I’m Ethan, I’m 25, and I’m at 700 Park Plaza. The building I’m in just partially collapsed. It was like an explosion, and now part of the structure is gone. There are a lot of people trapped under the debris, maybe 20 or more, and I can hear people screaming for help. Some of us made it outside, but others are still inside. Please send emergency services quickly; we need help right away!
