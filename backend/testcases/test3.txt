Hi, this is Sophia, I’m 35. I’m at the Sunset Mall parking lot, on the 3rd level, and I accidentally locked my keys in the car. My two-year-old is still inside, and it’s starting to get hot. It’s just me and my child here. I don’t have a way to get in, and I’m really worried. Please, can you send someone quickly?
