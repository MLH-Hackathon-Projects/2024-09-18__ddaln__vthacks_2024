Hello, this is Emma, and I’m at the intersection of 4th Street and Elm. I was just involved in a fender bender. There are two of us—me and the other driver—no one’s injured, but the cars are blocking the road. We’re causing a traffic jam, and I’m not sure what to do next. Can you send an officer to help us exchange information and clear the road?
