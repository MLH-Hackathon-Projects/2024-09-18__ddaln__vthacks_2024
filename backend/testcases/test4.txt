I’m calling from 113 Maple Avenue. There’s a guy hanging around outside my neighbor’s house, and it’s really strange. He’s been standing there for about 20 minutes, just looking in through their windows. I don’t think anyone’s home, and it’s making me nervous. I don’t know if he’s just lost or if something worse is going on, but I’d feel better if someone came by to check.
