Hi, this is Rachel, I’m 40. I live at 515 Willow Street. I can hear the neighbors fighting again, and this time it sounds worse than usual. There’s a lot of yelling, and I think things are getting violent. There are at least two people involved, and I don’t know if anyone is hurt, but I’m really concerned. Could you send someone to check on them?
