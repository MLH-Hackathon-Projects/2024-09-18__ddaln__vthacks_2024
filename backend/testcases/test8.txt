Hi, my name is Jake, I’m 27, and I’m at 203 Highland Drive. There’s a fire in my kitchen, and I tried to put it out with the extinguisher, but the flames keep coming back. There are two of us here, and I’ve gotten everyone out of the house, but the fire’s spreading fast. Please, I need the fire department as soon as possible.
